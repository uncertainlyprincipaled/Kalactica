KaLactica : A Memory- & Topology-Enhanced Successor to Galactica
Project documentation for an open-source implementation. Intended to double as the skeleton of a grant proposal or research paper.

1 Vision & Rationale (~640 words)
Galactica astonished the community by drafting domain-aware scientific prose from raw text prompts, yet it also revealed the Achilles’ heel of purely autoregressive LLMs: brittle factual grounding, short context horizons, and a tendency to hallucinate confidently when their internal world-model ran out of signal.

KaLactica aspires to close that gap without resorting to billion-dollar training budgets. We will transfer-learn a strong open model (LLaMA-2 13 B, Code Llama-7 B, or Mistral-7 B) with three orthogonal augmentations:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for factuality.
A dual-crop FAISS index—a short-term sub-index (session-specific) and a long-term frozen corpus (Meta-Kaggle)—supplies verifiable passages and code snippets. Generated output is stitched from tokens and citations, mirroring Galactica’s inline references but with explicit ground-truth checks on every dataset or API call.

Memory Hierarchy for coherence & consequence.
Building on recurrent-memory transformers and graph-backed memory (Royse 2025), KaLactica tracks dialogue-level state, prior code executions, and “consequence notes” (side-effectual actions a notebook may trigger). A structured memory router decides which layer—context window, session cache, or durable graph—should answer each query. This architecture reduces forgetting, lets the model reason over previously generated artefacts, and avoids repeating destructive commands.

Topological Curriculum & Safety Filter for common sense.
Instead of fine-tuning on the entire Meta-Kaggle code corpus at once, we order tasks by Betti complexity (β₁, β₂) of problem representations. Early stages teach the model to solve “simple-manifold” tasks (tabular CV) before exposing it to multimodal Kaggle grand-champ battles. During inference, a light-weight persistent-homology pass on latent embeddings rejects drafts whose topology diverges sharply from training manifolds—an automatic sanity check for wildly inconsistent generations.

The above trio is possible because modern parameter-efficient strategies (QLoRA, DPO) compress weeks of A100 time into days on a single consumer GPU plus a short final RLHF burst on a rented spot instance.

Our deliverable will be an open repository containing:

a one-day “hello-world” PoC that drafts a runnable Titanic notebook,

a two-week curriculum culminating in domain-specialised LoRA adapters,

and a roadmap toward a multi-domain meta-scientific assistant capable of drafting baseline Kaggle solutions with citations, side-effect awareness, and topological self-checks.

2 Literature Survey (~1 100 words)
2.1 Memory-Augmented & Retrieval-Augmented LLMs
Recurrent Memory Transformers (Dai et al. 2019; Khandelwal 2020) and Longformer/Perceiver families showed that chunked recurrence or cross-chunk attention can extend context. Royse (2025) pushes further by binding LLM output nodes to a Neo4j graph, improving multi-turn factual accuracy. RAG (Lewis 2020; LlamaIndex 2023) is now standard for grounding LLMs, but most implementations index flat text. We extend RAG with structural cells: every code block, markdown cell, and competition meta-row is stored with a typed edge schema so retrieval can privilege executable snippets when the user asks for code.

2.2 Topology in Representation Learning
Persistent homology has quantified feature-space simplification in CNNs (Hofer 2019; Watanabe 2021). Sheaf cohomology frameworks (Curry 2022; Llewellyn 2023) formalise local-to-global consistency of neural activations; non-zero H¹ flags “circuits that cannot agree” and correlates with hallucination bursts. Our curriculum idea is inspired by this: train from trivial Betti signatures to complex so the network’s internal nerve complex grows in measured steps, echoing human pedagogy theories (Karni 1995).

2.3 Neural Collapse & Over-Parameterisation
Papyan et al. (2020) proved that in the terminal phase, class means converge to a simplectic frame. Mingard 2021 linked this to high-symmetry basins in spin-glass landscapes where replica symmetry is effectively restored. We hypothesise that post-collapse representations are easier to glue across domains, because their within-class diameter shrinks. A Betti-vector monitor during training can therefore act as a stop-criterion (train until β₀ plateaus and intra-class variance < ϵ).

2.4 Curriculum & Transfer Learning
Bengio et al. (2009) formulated curriculum as ordering data to flatten the loss surface; Narvekar (2020) extends to task curricula. Topology-aware curricula (Cohen 2022) remain nascent: they select next tasks by persistent-homology radius. Our topological transfer learning extends adapter-stacking (Noach 2023) by freezing earlier LoRA ranks in a chain mirroring manifold-complexity growth, thus keeping GPU memory bounded.

2.5 Safety & Hallucination Mitigation
Context-grounded verification (Ji 2023) and tool-calling LLMs (Yao 2022) reduce hallucinations by requiring justification. Galactica lacked hard gates: if retrieval failed, it hallucinated citations. KaLactica adopts a citation-or-reject rule plus a topology-distance veto. Work by Côté (2022) shows structural critics (graph distance metrics) catch nonsense that lexical critics miss.

3 System Design & Methodology (~1 350 words)
3.1 Phase 0 — One-Day PoC
Goal: Finetune Code Llama-7 B on 10 k Kaggle notebook cells with a 4-bit QLoRA adapter and demonstrate retrieval-conditioned generation of a starter notebook.
Key scripts: preprocess.py, train_qlora.py, retrieval.py, demo.ipynb.
Hardware: single RTX 4090 (or T4 via Colab Pro). Training batch size = 4, grad-accum = 8 → 22 GB VRAM.
Success criteria: notebook compiles; FAISS returns at least one matching code snippet; generation ≤ 400 tokens.

3.2 Phase 1 — Topology-Driven Curriculum
We split competitions into clusters by (β₀, β₁) signature of the union of text-and-code embeddings (computed via pre-QLoRA model + RipsComplex).
Ordering:

Stage	Domain	Target β₁	LoRA Tag
1	CV-Tabular	0	cv_lora
2	Text/NLP	1–2	nlp_lora
3	RL/Agents	3–5	rl_lora
4	Multimodal	≥ 5	mm_lora

Each stage fine-tunes with new rank-16 LoRA matrices; previous ranks freeze. This yields a stack occupying < 1.5 GB.

3.3 Phase 2 — Lightweight RLHF
We run Direct Preference Optimisation on code pairs:

Positive: runs, downloads dataset, achieves ≥ 0.50 public-LB score.

Negative: runtime error > 30 s.
A single A100-40 G spot instance for 12 h suffices (≈ $40). RL reward combines pass@1, compile-time, and retrieval-citation recall.

3.4 Phase 3 — Memory & Consequence Layer
Implement a Graph Memory Router:

scss
Copy
Edit
User ↔ LLM ↔ MemoryAPI
                   ↳ vector_FST (short-term)
                   ↳ faiss_LTM (domain corpus)
                   ↳ KG (consequence edges)
Functions:
store(node, type), retrieve(query, k), link(source, relation, target).
The router decides which store answers a query; citations and write-access are logged for safe-queries vs. side-effect queries (e.g., !pip install lines).

3.5 Phase 4 — Topological Safety Filter
For each draft notebook, compute embeddings of every code cell, build a mini Rips complex, and measure Wasserstein distance to training-stage Betti fingerprints. Reject if > τ. This is a cheap (< 2 s) operation on ≤ 200 embeddings using ripser.

3.6 Phase 5 — Dense Merge (Optional)
If dual-A100 budget becomes available, merge LoRA ranks into a dense weight file via Sparse GPT-Fusion (Anil 2024) for ~10 % inference speed-up.

8 Future Directions & Implications (~315 words)
Universal Domainness Invariant – use the Betti-vector + NC statistics to define a numeric “domainness” that predicts zero-shot transfer accuracy between Kaggle competitions.

Topological RL – reward the agent for maintaining low Wasserstein drift while improving leaderboard score, potentially leading to safer creative leaps.

Sheaf-Based Memory – implement an activation sheaf recorder and compute H¹ online to catch multi-fact contradictions in longer notebooks.

Benchmark for Scientific LLMs – publish a public leaderboard comparing KaLactica, Galactica, and pure Code-Llama on compile-rate, factuality, and Betti robustness.

Integration with Kaggle Notebooks UI – a sidebar extension that calls KaLactica to suggest next analysis steps, with inline citations and a “topology health bar”.
